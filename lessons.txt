1/5
	- Excessive printing to console can cause crashes when run in pythonw (some kind of buffer overlow?)
	
	- Should have thought through architecture first - lack of DS_Stream class making stream management difficult
	
1/12
	- Class variables should be set in __init__ method. If set globally for the class and not reinitialized in constructor, they will be the same for all instances of the class
	
	- To convert list to DS_Stream, can overload operators
